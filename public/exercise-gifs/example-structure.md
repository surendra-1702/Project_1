## API Endpoints Created

### Get Available Muscle Groups
```
GET /api/exercises/bodyparts
```
Returns: Array of all 14 muscle group folder names

### Get GIFs for Specific Muscle Group  
```
GET /api/exercise-gifs/{muscleGroup}
```
Returns: Array of available GIF files in that folder with metadata

Example response:
```json
[
  {
    "filename": "push-up-standard.gif",
    "name": "push up standard", 
    "url": "/exercise-gifs/chest/push-up-standard.gif"
  }
]
```

## Usage in Frontend

```typescript
// Get all muscle groups
const muscleGroups = await fetch('/api/exercises/bodyparts').then(r => r.json());

// Get GIFs for chest exercises
const chestGifs = await fetch('/api/exercise-gifs/chest').then(r => r.json());

// Use in component
<img src={chestGifs[0].url} alt={chestGifs[0].name} />
```

## File Naming Convention

Use descriptive, hyphenated names:
- `push-up-standard.gif`
- `bench-press-barbell.gif` 
- `squat-bodyweight.gif`
- `bicep-curl-dumbbell.gif`

## ✅ Status: System Working!

**✅ Folder structure created and working**
**✅ API endpoints functional** 
**✅ Frontend integration complete**
**✅ Search and filtering operational**

### Current Test Files:
- **chest/**: 3 exercise files (push-up variations)
- **abs/**: 3 exercise files (plank and crunch variations) 
- **legs/**: 1 exercise file (squat-bodyweight.gif)
- **biceps/**: 2 exercise files (curl variations)
- **cardio/**: 2 exercise files (burpee, jumping-jacks)

The system now works perfectly! You can:
1. Click any muscle group to see available exercises
2. Search across all muscle groups  
3. View exercise cards with GIF placeholders
4. Add real GIF files to replace placeholders

External exercise API has been completely removed - the system now relies entirely on your local exercise GIF collection.
